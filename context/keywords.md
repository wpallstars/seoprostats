# seoprostats search targets

Standard: `~/.aidevops/agents/seo/keywords-standard.md`. Registry tables live in
`context/keywords/` and are edited with `aidevops keywords add|set` so TOON row
counts stay valid. Visual rules stay in `DESIGN.md`; voice and positioning stay
in `context/brand-identity.toon`.

## Positioning

- Who searches: _audience and their jobs; link to `context/brand-identity.toon`_
- What we want to be found for: _two or three pillar topics_
- What we will not compete on: _exclusions and negative keywords_

## Priorities

- _Pillar topics in order, with the reason (revenue, activation, authority)._

## Naming and metadata rules

- Slugs and file names: `aidevops keywords slug "<primary phrase>"`; one primary phrase per URL.
- Titles lead with the primary phrase in natural words; descriptions answer the query first.
- Image alt text describes what is visible first; add a phrase only when literally true.
- Tags, categories, topics and hashtags come from cluster rows, not ad hoc lists.

## Location targeting

- _Markets, locales, hreflang pairs, service areas; leave empty for global products._

## Entities and E-E-A-T

- Canonical entity names and `sameAs` profiles: `context/keywords/entities.toon`.
- _Qualified authors or reviewers per cluster and the evidence they bring._

## Channels

- _Social, PR, marketplaces and third-party publishing that should reuse these targets._

## Decisions

- _YYYY-MM-DD: decision and evidence._
